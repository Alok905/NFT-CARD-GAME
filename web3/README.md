# Sample Hardhat Project

I used fuji testnet in avalanche network.
To find the private key of c-chain avalanche network account, you have to connect your wallet to avalanche wallet by giving the secret phrase of consisting of 24 words. From there you can obtain the c-chain private key.


This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
